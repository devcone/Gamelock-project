# Gamelock-project
This is a HUGE project. This will lock games when people want to revise for work, school or want to distance themselves from games, i am the sole developer of this app and it will take me around a year to completely finish. I will also be using this for myself

## The UI
The ui is smart and simple. Below you will find each button's purpose within the app.

Schedule - The schedule window is not finished yet. But it will be able to show all of the scheduled "down times" over a one or two week period. The dimensions are planned to either be 1920x1080 or to fill the users whole screen to easily access and view the down times

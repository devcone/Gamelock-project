# Gamelock-project
This is a HUGE project. This will lock games when people want to revise for work, school or want to distance themselves from games, i am the sole developer of this app and it will take me around a year to completely finish. I will also be using this for myself

## The UI
The ui is smart and simple. Designed to be easily understandable and easy to use with everything you need to get started on the front page. Below you will find what each button does

Schedule - The schedule window is not finished yet. But it will be able to show all of the scheduled "down times" over a one or two week period. The dimensions are planned to either be 1920x1080 or to fill the users whole screen to easily access and view the down times
